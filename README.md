## Introduction

The Banking System is crafted using a microservices approach, employing Spring Boot and various Spring frameworks like Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security. Maven is used for dependency management. This setup ensures a modular architecture with services for user management, account operations, fund transfers, and transaction history, allowing for scalability and efficient management of banking operations.

## System Architecture

- **Service Discovery**: Employs a discovery service to enable microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically without hardcoding service endpoints.

- **API Gateway**: Serves as a centralized entry point for all API requests, providing security and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging.

- **Dedicated Databases**: Each microservice is backed by its own MySQL database, allowing for isolated data management and scalability.

## Microservices Overview

### üë• User Management Service
Manages user registration, profile updates, and authentication, ensuring secure user access across the application.

### üè¶ Account Management Service
Handles account creation, modification, and closure, providing users with detailed transaction histories and account details.

### üí∏ Fund Transfer Service
Facilitates fund transfers between accounts and provides comprehensive records of all transactions.

### üí≥ Transaction Service
Allows users to track transactions, deposits, and withdrawals for enhanced financial management.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17**: Ensure Java 17 is installed. [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
- **IDE**: Use an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Spring Tool Suite for development.
- **Git**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyanshagr/Spring-Boot-Microservices-Banking-Application.git
   cd Spring-Boot-Microservices-Banking-Application
   ```

2. **Build and Run Services**
   - Navigate to each microservice directory and start the services using your preferred build tool (Maven or Gradle).
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Configure Keycloak**
   - Set up Keycloak for handling authentication and authorization. Follow the [Keycloak configuration guide](LINK_TO_GUIDE) for detailed instructions.

4. **Service Dependencies**
   - Ensure all necessary services are running for full application functionality.

## Documentation Resources

### API Reference

Detailed API documentation is available, providing insights into each endpoint, request parameters, and response formats. Visit the [API Documentation](LINK_TO_API_DOCS) for more information.

### JavaDocs

Explore the [JavaDocs](LINK_TO_JAVADOCS) for comprehensive details about classes, methods, and variables across all microservices, aiding in development and maintenance.

## Planned Features

We aim to enhance the banking application with:

- **Notification System**: Notify users of key activities like transactions and account updates via email and SMS.
- **Investment Management**: Allow users to manage savings and investments, including fixed deposits and portfolio tracking.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
